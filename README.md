# Rentflicks and Chill

I built this app to show off my frontend skills ðŸš€  
You can check it out here: [\[Rentflicks and chill\]](https://nflixandchilll.web.app)

### What it does:

-   Login/signup with Google (via Firebase)
    
-   Clean styling with TailwindCSS
    
-   Search powered by ChatGPT to suggest movie names. Uses earlier model and can make mistakes.
    
-   Pulls movie details from TMDB API

-   Keys are free-tier so you won't be able to use it. To run it locally, feel free to use your own keys.

### Whatâ€™s next:

-   Make it look great on mobile ðŸ“±
    
-   Add playlists you can create and save

-   Support accesibility
    
-   Show movie previews when you hover
    
-   Beef up security (input validation, stop XSS, API limits, etc.)
    
-   Let users watch full length movies ðŸŽ¬
    
-   Smarter search + recommendations
